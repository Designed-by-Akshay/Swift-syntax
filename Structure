//Overview
//Do note that while declaring a struct its name should start with a capital
Struct Mystruct{
    
    init(){
    }
}

//Structures are like blue prints and the init() {} which is a constructor assigns values to the variables

//The structs hsould be refereced to a variable as follows

var struct = Mystruct()

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
//Sample code 


struct Town{
    
    let name : String
    var citizens : [String]
    var resources:[String:Int]
    
    init(name:String , people:[String], resources: [String:Int]) {
        self.name = name
        citizens = people
        self.resources = resources
    }

    //method ie inside a stucture /class if it was a standalone then it would be called a function
    func fortify(){
        print("Defences increased !")
    }

}

var anotherTown = Town(name: "Nameless Island", people: ["Tom Hanks"], resources: ["Coconuts":100])
anotherTown.fortify()
print(anotherTown.citizens)
anotherTown.citizens.append("Wilson")
print(anotherTown.citizens)


var ghostTown = Town(name: "Ghosty McGhostface", people: [], resources: ["Tumbleweed":1])

anotherTown.citizens.append("Wilson")
ghostTown.fortify()
